## Supported Boards ##

This code base already had supported for a handful of boards. However due to my limited collection, **only bold ones are (probably) guaranteed to run out of the box**. Other are merely implemented based on their schematics and needed help from you to make it work.

### NXP MCU ###

## Add your own board ##

If you don't possess any of supported board above. Don't worry you can easily implemented your own one by following this guide as long as the mcu is supported.

**Guide to implement a new board is coming soon** ...
