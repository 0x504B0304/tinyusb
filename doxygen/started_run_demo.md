For simplicity and user's convenience, there are only 2 basic application demos which are *Device* and *Host*. Each application demo has a few projects, each for its supported RTOS. For instance in the /demo/device you will find 3 projects

- device\_os\_none for no RTOS
- device\_freertos for freeRTOS
- device\_cmsis_rtx for ARM CMSIS with RTX implemenation
